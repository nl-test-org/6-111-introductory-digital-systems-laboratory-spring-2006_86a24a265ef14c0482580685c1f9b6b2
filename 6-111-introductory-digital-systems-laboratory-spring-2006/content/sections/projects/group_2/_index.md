Laser Pointer Mouse
-------------------

By Xinpeng Huang and William Putnam

Abstract
--------

The purpose of this project is to design an implement a laser pointer mouse. When doing a PowerPoint presentation or using the computer for any other occasion for which it is inconvenient to be sitting in front of it, users would like a way to control the computer remotely. The laser pointer mouse allows lecturers and presenters to point at the screen, and, with the press of a button, move the mouse cursor to the location of the laser, without ever touching the computer or mouse. A few more buttons allow the user to perform wirelessly transmitted left, right, and double clicks. Support for drawing over the screen, e.g. arrows and circles for increased presentation effectiveness, will be implemented as time permits. The system will be implemented in Verilog, and realized on the FPGA on the 6.111 labkit.
