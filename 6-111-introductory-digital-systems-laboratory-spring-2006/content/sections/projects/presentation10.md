description: 'Example of student work: final project presentation by Noel Campbell,
  Vivek Shah, and Raymond Tong. This project implements a networked video surveillance
  system in digital logic. It allows a user to view video input from a remote camera
  on a VGA monitor by capturing camera data, encoding it, transmitting it wirelessly,
  and subsequently receiving, decoding, and re-displaying the data. To test the system,
  the project is divided into three main components: video capture/display, data encoding/decoding,
  and wireless transmission/reception. Each part is put through a comprehensive series
  of tests using ModelSim and simulated data. Once each component passes design and
  functional tests, all three components are then connected to transmit video data
  wirelessly.'
