A Voice Training Karaoke Machine
--------------------------------

By Masood Qazi and Zhongying Zhou

Abstract
--------

A Karaoke machine will be implemented for the purpose of vocal training. It will have as its two primary inputs the user's singing and the notes from the sheet music of the vocals for a selected song. The user's voice will be recorded through a microphone interfaced to an analog to digital converter. The user's song will be analyzed with digital filters to determine the local spectral content. The system will then compare the user's singing, by pitch and rhythm, with what is described in the sheet music. This comparative analysis will be presented in a meaningful way to the user through a VGA display. Finally, the user will also have access to audio outputs such as the sequence of correct tones and the user's recorded voice through headphones.
