Wireless Surveillance System
----------------------------

By Noel Campbell, Vivek Shah, and Raymond Tong

Abstract
--------

This project implements a networked video surveillance system in digital logic. It allows a user to view video input from a remote camera on a VGA monitor by capturing camera data, encoding it, transmitting it wirelessly, and subsequently receiving, decoding, and re-displaying the data. To test the system, the project is divided into three main components: video capture/display, data encoding/decoding, and wireless transmission/reception. Each part is put through a comprehensive series of tests using ModelSim and simulated data. Once each component passes design and functional tests, all three components are then connected to transmit video data wirelessly.
