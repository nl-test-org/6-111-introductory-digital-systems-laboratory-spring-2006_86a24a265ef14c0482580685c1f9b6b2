description: 'Example of student work: project code for a final project by Leon Fay,
  Miranda Ha, and Vinith Misra (a.k.a The Tunafish Team). This project will implement
  a phase-array sonar system that will create a two-dimensional map of the environment
  directly in front of the array and display it on a screen for the user. The system
  will consist of one acoustic transmitter and a number of receivers. The receivers
  will be placed in a linear array spaced appropriately. Analysis of the phase relationships
  (to determine the angle) and delays (to calculate distances) in the receivers will
  allow a two-dimensional map of the environment to be drawn.'
