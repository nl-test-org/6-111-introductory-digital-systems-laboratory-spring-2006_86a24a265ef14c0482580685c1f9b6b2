description: 'Example of student work: project code for a final project by Mariela
  Buchin, WonRon Cho, and Scott Fisher. This project involves the creation of a "smart
  flight vest" that detects movements from a human body and translates them into parameters
  that determine the pitch and roll of an airplane in flight. The throttle of the
  plane is determined by a pressure sensor located under the pilot''s foot. The pilot
  flying the plane stands in front of a monitor that displays the main features of
  an airplane console, including an attitude indicator, a compass, and an altitude
  and vertical velocity display.'
