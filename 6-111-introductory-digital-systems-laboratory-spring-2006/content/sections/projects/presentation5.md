description: 'Example of student work: final project presentation by Igor Ginsburg.
  3D Pong takes MIT Pong to the next level with a 3D interface. At the heart of the
  project there is a hardware based 3D renderer. The renderer takes in a 3D model,
  specifically a sequence of colored triangles in a 3D space, and produces a 2D SVGA
  image. The view is controlled through a trackball mouse, which specifies rotations,
  translations and zoom. While the renderer can take in pre-built models stored in
  on-chip ROM, during gameplay a model of the current board is generated dynamically.'
