description: 'Example of student work: project code for a final project by Helen Liang,
  Wendi Li, David Meyer, Lucia Tian. Inspired by the FAO Schwartz piano, Piano Dance
  Revolution consists of a large piano keyboard projected onto the floor. The user
  interacts with the piano by stepping on the keys. At every step, the activated keys
  will light up and the corresponding note will play from the speakers. This is accomplished
  through three major components: the projectors, which project the image of the piano
  onto the ground and changes the color of the keys upon activation; the motion detection
  system, which detects the location of the player''s feet and determines the key
  stepped on; and audio output, which plays the activated note.'
