description: 'Example of student work: final project report by Leon Fay, Miranda Ha,
  and Vinith Misra (a.k.a The Tunafish Team). This project will implement a phase-array
  sonar system that will create a two-dimensional map of the environment directly
  in front of the array and display it on a screen for the user. The system will consist
  of one acoustic transmitter and a number of receivers. The receivers will be placed
  in a linear array spaced appropriately. Analysis of the phase relationships (to
  determine the angle) and delays (to calculate distances) in the receivers will allow
  a two-dimensional map of the environment to be drawn.'
